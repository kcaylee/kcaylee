## 🌟 About Me

I’m a final-year Bachelor of Computing student at Belgium Campus, specializing in Software Engineering and working toward becoming a full-stack developer. I thrive on turning complex problems into clean, user-focused solutions and I love the learning that comes with it.

Currently, I’m an **Intern Developer at First Digital**, where I contribute to building scalable applications and automating business processes using tools like **Nintex**. This role has deepened my understanding of both back-end logic and front-end usability, while also strengthening my skills in teamwork, adaptability, and clear communication.

I work confidently with **Java**, **Python**, **C#**, **JavaScript**, and **SQL**, and I enjoy thinking beyond code to how a solution impacts the user. Whether I’m debugging, testing, or enhancing functionality, I aim to write code that adds value and lasts.
